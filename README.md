## Update

2016/3/4: Create Homework1
2016/3/6: Add Batch Gradient Descent in HW1.
          Found bug:
		  1. Learning rate is actually difficult to choose. when you choose a
		  small one, you need relatively long time to convergence when degree 
		  is small.
		  when you choose a big one, the cost function just turn out to be 
		  "nan".
